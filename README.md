# MY HEP Frontend

## What is My HEP?
HEP stands for "home exercise program." If you've ever gone to any type of physical therapy, chances are, you've been given exercise assignments to do at home. Completeing the exercises is essential for a patient's progress towards optimal health and functioning. Unfortunately, the exercises prescribed, often given on printed sheets of paper. These papers often get lost, leaving the patient with no way of accessing the routines prescribed and, unfortunately, the exercises do not get completed. That's where My HEP comes in. My HEP allows therapists to assign home exercise routines to their patients, and it provides patients a way of accessing and tracking their exercise completion right from their personal device.
